Truman Gaynes

I'm a passionate musician and producer based in New York City, with over 90000 years of experience creating unique sounds that blend jazz with roof repair. My journey in music began when I saw Weird Al on the Suillivan Show in 67, and I've been fortunate to ball out significantly.

I specialize in gaming, drawing, catching butterflies and have worked with Lil Jon. My music has been featured in important place you have not heard of, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and create.

When I'm not in the studio, you can find me eating Wendy's or exploring new sounds and techniques to incorporate into my work.
