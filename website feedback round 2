website notes round 2:

- do we need captcha on contact page?
-visualizer and tracks need their own page
- index and general top bar could look a little more swaggy 
- all videos should be muted looping mp4s until clicked/hovered over rather than youtube links
- need to add a lot more visual stuff. not sure if i want to just do pictures of myself or other shi
- is background good white or should we try gradient?
- def need some swaggy gifs in there 
- silver/chrome y2k aesthetic could rly match the clean white look.
- the AI descriptions on the visualizer should not be there, also unable to test visualizer as of now so may have more feedback
- have to reconsider landing page cus feels empty. maybe open with bio, pic, and some tracks. the "education, focus, experience" part don't do much to fill out the empty space on homepage. i have to consider better ways to communicate who i am at a glance.
